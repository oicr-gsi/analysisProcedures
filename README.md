# Analysis Procedures

At OICR the GSI analysis team can process data through a variety of well-defined Analysis Procedures. This involves an analysis working directly with the project owner to collect the necessary information, then running the tools directly on our high-performance cluster to generate the analysis deliverables.

This repository tracks the script or workflows for each Analysis Procedure offered by the analysis team, as well as sample input and output data.
